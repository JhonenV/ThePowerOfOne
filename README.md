# "The Power Of One"
Seven Lakes Highschool held a project competition in which the theme was "the power of one", this is the project that we submitted

# Inspiration
This was our first time using pygame in any project!

heavily inspiried by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWN8GcmJ-jA) video

# Setup
Requires python >= 3.8 (that we've tested) and the pygame module, after you have these things it should run fine

One day we might come back and run it through py2exe for an easier setup

# Results
We did end up winning the competition :D
